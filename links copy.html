    <p id="intro"> Digital portfolios are an effective way to demonstrate and provide evidence of work from
prior experiences, both academic and professional. As stated by Barken, students' knowledge
production is supported through ePortfolios, which make normally unseen components of the
learning process visible and give students agency, which increases motivation. Digital portfolios
also provide more context, for potential clients or future employers, and can be included alongside
a resume and other documentation. Content management systems, such as Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, have made it
much easier to display these works and have become increasingly popular. A recent report revealed
that WordPress powers 34% of the entire web. Another report found in 2019, Wix had 120
million users. For these reasons, I will be teaching you how to use Squarespace to display your personal or
work portfolios.</p>
