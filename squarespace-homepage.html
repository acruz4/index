    <p class="tutorials" style="text-align: center; padding-right:4%; padding-left:4%; margin-bottom:-2%"> <strong>Please note:</strong> While building a portfolio is free, publishing and hosting it is <strong>not.</strong> It is quite expensive. Keep this in mind as you are moving forward in this website. </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p class="intro"> <strong><abbr title="ePortfolios">Digital portfolios</abbr></strong> are an effective way to demonstrate and provide evidence of work from
prior experiences, both academic and professional. As stated by Paul Basken from <cite>The Chronicle of Higher Education</cite>, "knowledge production is supported through ePortfolios, which make normally unseen components of the
learning process visible and give students agency, which increases motivation". They also provide more context for potential clients or future employers, and can be included alongside a resume and other documentation. Content management systems, such as <strong> Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress, </strong> have made it much easier to display these works and have become increasingly popular. </p>

    <blockquote> A recent report revealed that WordPress <strong>powers 34% of the entire web</strong>.
    <br>Another report found in 2019, <strong> Wix had 120 million users </strong>. </blockquote> <br>
  <p class="intro">For these reasons, I will be teaching how to use Squarespace to display your personal or
    work portfolios.</p>
  <h2> Effective practices for designing educational web pages</h2>
    <p class="intro" style="text-align: left;"> This website project demonstrates effective practices in several ways. The navigation showcases key information, that is organized by content. The text is minimized, written in short paragraphs, and utilizes white space. Specifically, the language used is simple, brief, and is easy to follow. The overall design of the website is manageable, clean, and is responsive. Additionally, it is ADA compliant through color contrast.
	Furthermore, this website was created around the temporal contiguity, learner control, and coherence instructional design theories. There are brief descriptions underneath each video and there are closed captions within. Additionally, The users will have numerous opportunities to facilitate their learning. They have the option to visit specific pages and control the pace of the videos. If a user wants to leave the site, they can always revisit. The resource, overall being a website, allows all levels of learners to have the ability to control their learning through unlimited access and review, which removes the limitation of time. </p>
