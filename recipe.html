    <h1> How to make <abbr title="Coconut Icee">Limber de Coco</abbr></h1>
      <p> I made Coconut Limbers (as I used to call them) with my Dad when I was younger. This was one of my <em>first</em> introductions to cooking. I was so fascinated by making them and this memory has stood with me over time.
    The following recipe comes from this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021358-limber-de-coco">New York Times article</a> by <cite> Millie <del>Peachtree</del> <ins>Peartree</ins></cite>. </p>
