    <img src="images/AC-2021.jpg" alt="Alyssa Cruz" align="left" style="margin: 0px 15px" width="11%" height="11%"> </a> <p> This is my third semester in the IDN program! I have my bachelor's in Graphic Design. I currently work as a Communications Assistant at Yale University and own my business doing freelance work. I have been a resident of CT my entire life. Some of my hobbies include playing video games and photography.</p>
    <h3> Here is a bit more on my background: </h3>
    <p> My interest in digital technology started with my first GameCube. If I was not playing video games, I was on my mom's PC Desktop. I formally started studying technology in high school. These classes were introductory courses to Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere. In college, I took classes focused on technology, including Graphic Design and Photography. I am always open to learning more about technology and I am interested to see how much more I learn from this class. </p>
    <h4>Here are some fun facts about me: </h4>
      <p> If I could have any superpower, it would be teleportation.
        <br>One thing I cannot live without is my camera.
        <br>A Disney character I would be is Rapunzel because we both love the floating lights. </p>
