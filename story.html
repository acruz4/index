    <h1> The day was October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017... </h1>
    <p> My best friend and I were Graphic Design majors completing a photography requirement. After a discussion with our professor, we decided to take a trip to <abbr title="West Rock Ridge State Park">West Rock</abbr>.
      <br><br>The issue? We were <strong> unfamiliar with <em> New Haven</em>. </strong> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Getting to West Rock was the easy part. But, of course, we ended up in the wrong area. To solve the issue, we decided to follow the Map app on my <del>cell phone</del> <ins>iPhone</ins>. To quote Jacob Cass from <cite> Just Creative, </cite></p>
    <blockquote> "There are no bad ideas, just bad decisions." </blockquote>
    <p> So we ended up walking up West Rock. And all the way back down. After a two hours, we made it.<br> It took a long time, and at points felt very <s>confused</s> lost.
      But, we completed our assignment while having some amazing views. As much as I enjoyed my time, I know the moral of the story here is to be more prepared.</p>
    <h3> Here is a picture I took of the lake (H<sub>2</sub>0).</h3>
